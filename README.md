Analysis of Secondary Assists and Drives of Miami HEAT

Secondary Assists:
I wanted to analyze players in Miami HEAT who are really good at creating plays by passing, but don't necessarily rake up traditional "Assists" in their box score. There players who don't get a ton of traditional assists, but get a lots of "Secondary Assists". The guy who passes it to the assister. The hockey assist.

As we can see from the bar graph above, Miami HEAT has the lowest number of secondary assists. This is an area where the team can improve


2) Drives:
Analysis of drives of Miami HEAT:
Driving to the basket is standard in the NBA. You can make a layup, get fouled, or kick it out for a 3PT assist. I was curious how Miami HEAT did compared to other teams. I wanted to analyze the drives of Miami HEAT.

Bar graph to show total number of drives by each player in Miami HEAT





















It turned out, Miami gets the least points per drive of any team in the NBA. To figure out why, first, note that Dragic is the main "driver" of The Heat.

So why is do Dragic drives not lead to points? First, for the high number of drives Dragic s, he hardly gets fouled. He has committed ~700 drives so far this season, but he gets fouled at the rate of someone who only has ~350 drives. Fouls are by far the most efficient way to end a drive.

Additionally, he is not great at making baskets out of drives. He is not as much of an anomaly here, but he is still on the low end.











































So what does Dragic do out of drives? Dragic loves to pass out of drives. He really stands out as someone who loves to pass when he drives. Unfortunately, he is not very efficient in turning those passes in to assists. Perhaps he needs to commit to the drive more often.
